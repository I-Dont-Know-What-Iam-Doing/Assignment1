Front End Dev Project (Honkai Star Rail Sandbox):
This project is mainly to help people keep up with the latest news about the game such as through the news and update page, Tier List page to see the current teams and which characters have fallen off/gotten better and most importantly a sandbox area to help users with stats making for specific characters and relic stats. This essentially help players with seeing which kind of relic and stat combination give the most damage output value.



Design process:
Design process of this web is simple, it's to make it user friendly and cater to all audiences who happen to stumble upon the website. The project helps the users gain a valuable insight into how the game characters roughyl work alongside their best team as seen in the tier list and a build test page to help users with character optimization through the best relic set and stats.
